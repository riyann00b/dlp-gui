## VLC H264 Playback Issue (AUR)

If you're using VLC installed via AUR and facing issues like:

> VLC could not decode the format "h264" (H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10))

This is a known issue with the AUR build of VLC.

### Workarounds:
- Use the Flatpak version of VLC (`flatpak install org.videolan.VLC`)
- Or rebuild VLC with H264 codec support enabled
